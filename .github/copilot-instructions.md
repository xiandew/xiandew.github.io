# AI Coding Agent Instructions — Personal GitHub Website (Static)

## Purpose

This is a **static personal GitHub website** whose primary goal is to communicate professionalism, design taste, and attention to detail within seconds.

The website should feel deliberate, refined, and frictionless.

Visitors should immediately perceive:

- technical maturity  
- strong design judgment  
- clarity of thought  
- craftsmanship  

This is not just a website — it is a **signal artifact**.

# Primary Directive

## UI and UX are the highest priority.

If forced to choose between:

- clever code vs intuitive UX → choose UX  
- visual polish vs architectural purity → choose polish  
- fewer features vs better experience → choose experience  

Users remember how a site feels more than how it is built.

---

# Error Resolution Mandate (Non-Negotiable)

The agent must aggressively prevent and resolve all errors.

## Never Leave:

- console errors  
- broken links  
- layout shifts  
- hydration mismatches  
- accessibility violations  
- missing assets  
- mobile rendering issues  
- overlapping elements  
- unresponsive controls  

If an error is detected or likely:

👉 Fix it immediately.  
👉 Prefer defensive patterns.  
👉 Validate assumptions.  

Do not ship fragile UI.

---

# Design Philosophy

## Default to Elegant Restraint

Prioritize:

- clean spacing  
- strong typography  
- visual hierarchy  
- predictable navigation  
- calm color usage  

Avoid visual noise.

**Professional > flashy**

---

## The “Senior Engineer Test”

Before generating UI, implicitly ask:

> Would a senior engineer proudly attach their name to this?

If not — simplify.

---

# UX Standards

## The site must feel:

- fast  
- obvious  
- lightweight  
- modern  
- intentional  

Users should never have to “figure things out.”

---

## Navigation Principles

- Keep navigation minimal.
- Avoid deep hierarchies.
- Every page must justify its existence.
- Reduce cognitive load wherever possible.

If something can be removed — remove it.

---

## Content Clarity

Prefer clarity over personality gimmicks.

Good:

✔ clear headings  
✔ short paragraphs  
✔ scannable layouts  
✔ meaningful labels  

Avoid:

❌ clever but confusing copy  
❌ walls of text  
❌ ambiguous buttons  
❌ novelty UI  

---

# Visual Hierarchy Rules

Always ensure clear distinction between:

1. Primary focus  
2. Supporting content  
3. Secondary details  

Use spacing before adding borders or dividers.

Whitespace is a design tool — use it generously.

---

# Typography Guidance

- Favor highly readable fonts.
- Maintain consistent scale.
- Avoid excessive font weights.
- Limit variation.

Typography alone should elevate the site.

---

# Color Discipline

Use color intentionally — not decoratively.

Guidelines:

- One primary color is often enough.
- Ensure strong contrast.
- Meet accessibility standards.
- Avoid overly saturated palettes.

When unsure:

👉 Reduce color usage.

---

# Responsiveness (Mandatory)

Design mobile-first.

The site must look **excellent**, not merely functional, on:

- phones  
- tablets  
- laptops  
- large monitors  

Never allow:

- horizontal scrolling  
- cramped text  
- broken grids  
- tiny tap targets  

Mobile experience is not secondary.

---

# Performance Expectations

Static sites should feel instant.

Avoid introducing anything that harms perceived speed.

Prefer:

- lightweight assets  
- optimized images  
- minimal script usage  
- system capabilities over heavy libraries  

Speed directly influences perceived quality.

---

# Accessibility Baseline

Accessibility is part of good design.

Always ensure:

- sufficient color contrast  
- semantic structure  
- keyboard navigability  
- descriptive alt text  
- logical heading order  

Accessible design feels more professional to everyone.

---

# Interaction Design

Subtlety wins.

Prefer:

- short transitions  
- smooth hover states  
- gentle feedback  
- predictable behavior  

Avoid:

- long animations  
- dramatic motion  
- attention-seeking effects  

Motion should support usability — never compete with it.

---

# Layout Discipline

Use consistent spacing rules.

Maintain alignment.

Avoid uneven visual weight.

If a layout feels “almost right,” refine it until it is unmistakably right.

Precision signals craftsmanship.

---

# Content Strategy

This website should communicate value quickly.

Within a few seconds, visitors should understand:

- who you are  
- what you do  
- what makes you credible  

Front-load important information.

Do not bury signal beneath decoration.

---

# What This Website Is NOT

- Not a playground  
- Not trend-chasing  
- Not animation-driven  
- Not experimental at the cost of usability  
- Not cluttered  

Restraint is a competitive advantage.

---

# Decision Heuristic

When multiple design options exist, choose the one that maximizes:

**clarity → usability → aesthetics → personality**

(In that order.)

---

# Agent Behavior Rules

When generating or modifying the site:

✅ simplify before adding  
✅ remove friction  
✅ fix inconsistencies  
✅ align elements precisely  
✅ ensure responsiveness  
✅ eliminate errors immediately  

Automatically bias toward professional-grade output.

---

# Final Standard

> The site should feel like it was built by someone who cares deeply about quality.

Aim for the reaction:

**“This is clean. This is sharp. This is professional.”**
