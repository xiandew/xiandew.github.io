		<h1 class="ascii-section-title" data-ascii-glitch>Paul Wen</h1>
		<p class="ascii-lede">
			I'm a software engineer based in Melbourne who's spent the last eight years building systems 
			for biotech research and regulated industries. I like the kind of work where "it worked on my machine" 
			isn't good enough—compliance systems, funding workflows, production platforms used by hundreds of people daily.
			I'm happiest when I can own a problem from requirements through to deployment, making sure it's 
			secure, maintainable, and actually solves the problem it's meant to.

				<li>
					<b>AI compliance reporting system</b> — Replaced a manual, error-prone audit report process with an AI-powered 
					platform using Flask, React, and Databricks. Built RAG pipelines that inject current protocols at generation time, 
					with human-in-the-loop approval. The system needed to be traceable, secure, and meet strict regulatory requirements—so 
					I designed role-based access, secure file ingestion APIs, and an approval workflow that keeps life scientists in control.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Research evaluation platform</b> — Led a small team to build a full-stack system (React/TypeScript/Node.js) 
					for assessing academic research submissions across multiple therapeutic areas. The old process was spreadsheet chaos—now 
					it's a governed workflow with multi-stage reviews, real-time dashboards, and AI sentiment analysis that surfaces decision 
					signals. We cut evaluation time by nearly a week per cycle and gave the team actual visibility into their pipeline.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Legacy platform modernisation</b> — Migrated on-prem SharePoint 2013 systems to the cloud. Rebuilt UIs with modern 
					React patterns, refactored backend logic into proper services, and implemented CI/CD with automated testing. The kind of 
					work that doesn't make headlines but keeps enterprises functional and secure.

		<p class="ascii-eyebrow">How I work</p>
		<h2 class="ascii-section-title" data-ascii-glitch>Delivery over perfection</h2>
		<p class="ascii-lede">
			I've learned that great systems come from understanding constraints, not ignoring them. In regulated environments, 
			you can't just ship fast and fix later—but you also can't wait for perfect requirements. So I spend time upfront 
			with stakeholders making trade-offs explicit: what's possible now, what needs more infrastructure, what's genuinely 
			out of scope. Then I build iteratively with strong CI/CD, automated testing, and security baked in from day one.
		</p>
		<p class="ascii-lede">
			I also think a lot about what happens after deployment. Who operates this? How do we debug it? What breaks when 
			the team grows? Building for the long term means clear APIs, proper access controls, and boring reliability—not clever abstractions.

			<ul class="ascii-list" style="line-height: 1.85;">
				<li>Auditability first—every action needs a trail, especially in compliance systems.</li>
				<li>Simple interfaces over clever coupling. If I can't explain how it works, it's too complex.</li>
				<li>Humans in the loop where it matters. AI can help, but critical decisions need review.</li>
				<li>Ship early, test often, and fix production issues before they cascade.</li>

		<h2 class="ascii-section-title" data-ascii-glitch>What I work with</h2>
		<div class="ascii-surface" style="padding: 18px; margin-top: 14px;">
			<p class="ascii-muted" style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.85;">
				Most of my work is TypeScript and Node.js on the backend, React on the frontend. I build REST APIs, work with 
				PostgreSQL and MongoDB for persistence, and deploy via Docker and CI/CD pipelines on Azure and AWS. For AI systems, 
				I've been working with RAG patterns, Databricks pre-trained models, and designing review workflows that keep humans 
				in control where it matters. I also spend a lot of time on authentication (OAuth2/OIDC, Azure AD) and implementing 
				proper RBAC since most of what I build needs to be secure and auditable.

			If you're working on something where systems need to be secure, compliant, and actually maintainable—or
